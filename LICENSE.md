License Agreement Random Walk Imaging Code

This License is granted by Random Walk Imaging AB, a Swedish company registered 
under company No 559368-5547, having its principle place of business located 
at Villavägen 8, 232 53 Åkarp, Sweden to the individual and/or entity that 
has downloaded the Program covered by this Agreement or subsequently 
received the Program by distribution permitted by the terms of 
this Agreement. 

Background

This license contains the terms and conditions for the use of the Program 
(as defined below) in teaching, scientific and clinical research, 
and only provided that the Program then is used for non-commercial purpose. 

The licensee is given the rights to use the Program, to distribute the 
software, to receive the source code, to change and modify the Program and 
to distribute any modified or changed Program under this license. The 
distribution of modified or changed Program is dependent on that the 
conditions set forth in this license are met. 

What are the rights given to non-commercial licensees? Similarly to GPL, 
you have the right to use the software, to distribute copies, to receive 
source code, to change the software and distribute your modifications or 
the modified software. Also similarly to the GPL, if you distribute verbatim 
or modified copies of this software, they must be distributed under this 
license.

By modelling the GPL, this license guarantees that you're safe when using 
the Program in teaching, scientific and clinical research. This 
license guarantees that the Program will remain available free of charge 
for non-commercial use. You can modify the Program to your purposes, and 
you can also share your modifications. 

We believe that the combination of non-commercial open-source and commercial
licensing will be beneficial for the whole user community, because income 
from commercial licenses will enable faster development and a higher level 
of software quality, while further enjoying the informal, open communication
and collaboration channels of open source development.

actions if a licensee does not accept the terms given in the license. By, 
using, receiving the source code, modifying or distributing the Program or 
any work based on the Program, the licensee indicates its acceptance of 
this license and all terms and conditions. 



8. Prohibition of imposing further restrictions on the recipient

When the licensee redistributes the Program or any work based on the 
Program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
licensor including all the rights granted by the license. The licensee may
